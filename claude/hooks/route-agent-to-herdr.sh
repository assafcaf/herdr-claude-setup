# PreToolUse(Agent) — keep delegated work visible in Herdr.
#
# The Agent tool's subagents run in-process inside the calling session. They have no PTY, no
# child process and no session id, so Herdr cannot see them: they do not appear in
# `herdr agent list`, they occupy no pane, and there is no way to watch, prompt or interrupt
# one from the TUI. A team assembled that way is invisible to the operator by construction.
#
# So: work that writes, or that runs long enough to be worth watching, is redirected to
# the herdr-spawn.sh beside this hook, which puts a real `claude` session in a real pane inside
# the task's tab. Cheap read-only lookups stay in-process, because turning a five-second
# file search into a pane, a process spawn and a teardown is not worth the visibility.
#
# Where the line sits, and why:
#
#   allowed   Explore              read-only tool set; the fan-out search case
#   allowed   claude-code-guide    read-only; docs lookup
#   allowed   statusline-setup     Read+Edit on one settings file, seconds long
#   allowed   evidence-reviewer    a read-only auditor pattern: Read/Grep/Glob, reports only
#   blocked   general-purpose      has every tool, including Write and Edit
#   blocked   Plan                 long-running by design; worth watching
#   blocked   claude               catch-all with every tool
#   blocked   anything unlisted    unknown capability defaults to visible
#
# A note on what was asked versus what is implemented. The intent agreed with the operator
# was "allow single read-only lookups, block parallel or writing ones". Parallelism is not
# observable here: PreToolUse fires once per tool call, and parallel calls arrive as separate
# invocations of this script with nothing in the payload tying them together. Timing games
# ("did another Agent call fire within two seconds?") would be racy and would block the
# second call rather than the batch. Capability is observable, so the rule keys on that
# instead: a subagent that can only read is cheap enough to allow however many run at once.
# Edit ALLOWED_TYPES below to move the line.
#
# Escape hatches, both deliberate:
#   - outside Herdr (HERDR_ENV != 1) nothing is blocked, because the spawner cannot run there
#     and a hook with no available alternative is just a wall;
#   - CC_ALLOW_INPROCESS_AGENTS=1 disables the redirect for one session.

Blocked by $HOOK_DIR/route-agent-to-herdr.sh: subagent_type '$subagent_type' runs
in-process, where Herdr cannot see it.${description:+ (task: $description)}

In-process subagents have no pane, no name and no session id, so they never appear in
\`herdr agent list\` and cannot be watched, prompted or interrupted from the TUI.

Spawn it into a pane instead — one tab per task, one pane per agent:

    bash $SPAWNER <agent-name> \\
      --task <task-slug> \\
      --orchestrator <your own name from ListAgents> \\
      --prompt "<the same instructions you were about to pass>"

Then drive it with the name you chose:

    herdr agent get <agent-name>                 # idle | working | blocked | done
    herdr agent read <agent-name> --source recent-unwrapped --lines 120
    SendMessage({to: "<agent-name>", message: "..."})

See $SPAWN_SKILL for the full loop, including teardown.

If this really is a cheap read-only lookup, use subagent_type 'Explore' instead.
