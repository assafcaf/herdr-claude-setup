# Spawn one named Claude session into a Herdr pane, inside this task's tab.
#
# Why this exists
# ---------------
# The Agent tool's subagents run *in-process* inside the calling session: no PTY, no child
# process, no session id of their own. Herdr recognises agents by inspecting what occupies a
# pane, so an in-process subagent is invisible to it and always will be — `pane report-agent`
# needs a real pane_id, so not even a hook can conjure one without creating an empty pane
# that displays nothing. Making a delegated agent visible therefore means spawning a real
# `claude` process into a real pane. That is all this script does.
#
# The payoff is that one spawn produces three identities that already line up:
#
#   herdr agent name   `herdr agent prompt|read|wait|get <name>`   (pane control)
#   Claude Code name   SendMessage({to: "<name>"})                 (agent-to-agent messages)
#   session uuid       reported by `herdr agent list` as           (the join key between them)
#                      .agents[].agent_session.value
#
# Verified on 2026-09-10: `herdr agent list` reported this repo's live sessions with
# agent_session.value equal to each one's $CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID. Herdr panes and Claude
# Code peer sessions are one-to-one already; --name and --session-id only let us choose both
# sides of the mapping up front instead of reading it back afterwards.
#
# Topology: one tab per task, one pane per agent. The tab is found by its label and created
# on first use, so the second and later agents of a task land beside their siblings rather
# than in a tab of their own. Closing the tab tears the whole team down.
#
# Usage
#   herdr-spawn.sh <name> --task <slug> [options] [-- <claude args...>]
#
#   --task <slug>          tab label; the unit that groups one team           (required)
#   --prompt <text>        submitted after the agent reports ready
#   --orchestrator <name>  this session's Claude Code peer name, so the child can
#                          SendMessage back; read it from ListAgents
#   --cwd <path>           working directory for the pane        (default: $PWD)
#   --trust                record --cwd as trusted before spawning, instead of refusing
#                          to spawn into a directory Claude Code would stop and ask about
#   --env KEY=VALUE        extra env for the pane; repeatable
#   --wait                 block until the prompt settles (idle|done|blocked)
#   --timeout <ms>         bound for --wait                      (default 300000)
#   --dry-run              print the herdr commands, touch nothing
#   --                     everything after is passed to `claude` verbatim
#
# Every spawned pane also receives:
#   CC_TEAM_TASK, CC_TEAM_AGENT, CC_TEAM_ORCHESTRATOR, CC_TEAM_ORCHESTRATOR_PANE,
#   CC_TEAM_ORCHESTRATOR_SESSION_AT_START
#
# Prints one JSON line describing the spawn.

# Trust preflight — run before anything is created, so a refusal costs no pane.
#
# Claude Code gates each working directory behind a one-time "Is this a project you created
# or one you trust?" dialog and records the answer in ~/.claude.json as
# projects["<cwd>"].hasTrustDialogAccepted. No flag answers it: `claude --help` documents the
# dialog being skipped only in non-interactive mode (-p, or a non-TTY stdout), which is not
# what a pane is. So a spawn into an untrusted directory sits on the dialog, never reaches
# interactive_ready, and `herdr agent start` fails naming a pane rather than a cause.

#   herdr-spawn: herdr agent start failed for 'newdirprobe' in pane w7:pM
# with the trust dialog on screen in that pane. Spawns into an already-trusted repo, and into
# a worktree beneath it that had no entry of its own, both came up clean — trust covers
